## Rockdot Commons

Rockdot Commons consist of
* Highly customizable, rock solid UI Components (Button, Radio, Checkbox, DropDown, Scrollable, List, Pager, Gallery)
* Implementation of Material Design (Polymer Paper Components), see examples below.
* Port of [AS3 Commons](http://www.as3commons.org/) projects to Dart/StageXL.
* Port of [Flexbook](http://www.rubenswieringa.com/code/as3/flex/Book/), see examples below.

#### Lang
Language utilities and extensions.
* Assertion
* Class
* List Ordering
* String

In order to demonstrate the flexibility of UI components, a full port of Polymer's Paper elements was created.
