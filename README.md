## Acanvas Commons

Acanvas Commons consist of
* Highly customizable, rock solid UI Components (Button, Radio, Checkbox, DropDown, Scrollable, List, Pager, Gallery)
* Implementation of Material Design (Polymer Paper Components), see examples below.
* Port of [AS3 Commons](http://www.as3commons.org/) projects to Dart/StageXL.
* Port of [Flexbook](http://www.rubenswieringa.com/code/as3/flex/Book/), see examples below.

#### Async
A library that aims to make working with asynchronous processes easier. 
Providing operation, command, ~~service~~ and ~~task~~ interfaces.
##### To be converted into

#### EventBus
The EventBus is used as a publish/subscribe event mechanism that lets objects communicate with each other in a loosely coupled way. 
It offers event subscription based on event name, ~~event class~~ or for ~~specific topics~~. 
~~An interception mechanism is in place to block or alter incoming events or event listeners being added.~~

#### Lang
Language utilities and extensions.
* Assertion
* Class
* List Ordering
* String
* Cloneable, Disposable, and Ordered interfaces

#### Logging
An abstraction over Dart Logger implementation, featuring log levels.

#### Material Design Examples

In order to demonstrate the flexibility of UI components, a full port of Polymer's Paper elements was created.
